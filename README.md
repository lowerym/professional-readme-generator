# Professional README Generator

## Description
We had to build a professional README generator using node for this project.js. I created an application that generated a README file based on how the user answers various questions presented to them. By opening the program in VS Code, opening the terminal, and entering "node index.js," you'll be asked questions about the title of your project, a brief description, your GitHub username, email, etc. After answering the questions, a README file is generated with all the information the user added, complete with a Table of Contents that divides all the data into various sections.
